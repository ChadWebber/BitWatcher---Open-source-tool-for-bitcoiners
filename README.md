# BitWatcher — Open source tool for bitcoiners

This repository will host the open-source Bitcoin dashboard we’re building. It will display live Bitcoin price charts (1 day, 1 year, 5 years) with overlays for the 200-day and 200-week moving averages and all-time highs, along with wallet lookup and donation features.

For now, please see the preview HTML file attached in our earlier chat. We’ll integrate it here as we continue development.
